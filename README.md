But if you were to sign up with an already existing username or email then you receive an error

Where on the navbar , you are getting welcomed with your username mentioned and a Log out button . On the left sidebar there are other users whom you can follow. And in the middle , there is an option to post your contents and below it you can see posts from other users.
You can create your own content and post it.
